    lyrics: `If you ever leave me, baby
    Leave some morphine at my door
    'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
    To realize what we used to have
    We don't have it anymore
    There's no religion that could save me
    No matter how long my knees are on the floor, oh
    So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'
    To keep you by my side
    To keep you from walkin' out the door
    
    'Cause there'll be no sunlight
    If I lose you, baby
    There'll be no clear skies
    If I lose you, baby
    Just like the clouds
    My eyes will do the same if you walk away
    Every day, it'll rain
    Rain, rain
    
    I'll never be your mother's favorite
    Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
    Ooh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing
    Saying, "There goes my little girl
    Walking with that troublesome guy"
    But they're just afraid of something they can't understand
    Ooh, but, little darling, watch me change their minds
    Yeah, for you, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try
    
    And pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleedin'
    If that'll make you mine
    
    'Cause there'll be no sunlight
    If I lose you, baby
    There'll be no clear skies
    If I lose you, baby
    Just like the clouds
    My eyes will do the same if you walk away
    Every day, it'll rain
    Rain, rain
    
    Ooh, don't you say (Don't you say)
    Goodbye (Goodbye)
    Don't you say (Don't you say)
    Goodbye (Goodbye)
    
    I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleedin'
    If that'll make it right
    
    'Cause there'll be no sunlight
    If I lose you, baby
    And there'll be no clear skies
    If I lose you, baby
    And just like the clouds
    My eyes will do the same if you walk away
    Every day, it'll rain
    Rain, rain`,

    Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
    When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down

    It all just sounds like ooh, ooh, ooh, hoo
    Mm, too young, too dumb to realize
    That I should have bought you flowers
    And held your hand
    Should have gave you all my hours
    When I had the chance
    Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
    Now my baby's dancing
    But she's dancing with another man
    My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
    Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
    Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
    And that haunts me every time I close my eyes

    Should have gave you all my hours

    Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
    Now my baby's dancing
    But she's dancing with another man
    Although it hurts
    I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
    Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
    To try and apologize for my mistakes
    But I just want you to know
    I hope he buys you flowers
    I hope he holds your hand
    Give you all his hours

    To the beat (rolling in the deep)
    Baby, I have no story to be told
    But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
    Think of me in the depths of your despair
    Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

    Throw your soul through every open door (whoa)
    Count your blessings to find what you look for (whoa)
    Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (whoa)
    You pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown
    We could've had it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
    We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
    It all, it all, it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

    Hello, how are you?
    It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
    I hope that you're well
    Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
    It's no secret that the both of us
    Are running out of time
    So hello from the other side (other side)

    People always told me be careful of what you do
    And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
    And mother always told me be careful of who you love

    She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
    But the kid is not my son
    She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
    For forty days and forty nights
    The law was on her side
    But who can stand when she's in demand
    Her schemes and plans
    'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
    So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
    (Do think twice, do think twice)
    She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
    Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no)
    'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
    People always told me be careful of what you do

    She came and stood right by me
    Just the smell of sweet perfume
    This happened much too soon

    You know what you did, (she says he is my son) breaking my heart babe
    She says I am the one

    Billie Jean is not my lover
    Billie Jean is not my lover
    Billie Jean is not my lover (don't Billie Jean)

    lyrics: `It's close to midnight
    And something evil's lurking in the dark
    Under the moonlight
    You see a sight that almost stops your heart
    You try to scream
    But terror takes the sound before you make it
    You start to freeze
    As horror looks you right between the eyes
    You're paralyzed
    'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
    And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
    You know it's thriller, thriller night
    You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight, yeah
    Ooh, ooh
    You hear the door slam
    And realize there's nowhere left to run
    You feel the cold hand
    And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
    You close your eyes
    And hope that this is just imagination
    Girl, but all the while
    You hear a creature creepin' up behind
    You're out of time
    'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
    There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl
    Thriller, thriller night
    You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight
    Night creatures call
    And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
    There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time (they're open wide)
    This is the end of your life, ooh
    They're out to get you
    There's demons closin' in on every side
    They will possess you
    Unless you change that number on your dial
    Now is the time
    For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
    All through the night
    I'll save you from the terror on the screen
    I'll make you see
    That this is thriller, thriller night
    'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
    Thriller, thriller night
    So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller
    Chiller, thriller here tonight
    'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
    Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
    Thriller, thriller night
    So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller, ow
    I'm gonna thrill you tonight
    Darkness falls across the land
    The midnight hour is close at hand
    Creatures crawl in search of blood
    To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
    And whosoever shall be found
    Without the soul for getting down
    Must stand and face the hounds of hell
    And rot inside a corpse's shell
    I'm gonna thrill you tonight
    Thriller, ooh baby (thriller)
    I'm gonna thrill you tonight (thriller night)
    Thriller, all night, oh baby
    I'm gonna thrill you tonight
    Thriller, thriller night (oh baby)
    I'm gonna thrill you tonight
    Thriller, all night (oh baby)
    Thriller night, babe (thriller night, babe), ooh
    The foulest stench is in the air
    The funk of forty thousand years
    And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
    Are closing in to seal your doom
    And though you fight to stay alive
    Your body starts to shiver
    For no mere mortal can resist
    The evil of the thriller`,

    You are not alone
    You are not alone
    Not alone, not alone

    In the morning, in the evening
    Not alone, not alone
    You and me
    Not alone

    Drawing hearts in the byline
    Always taking up too much space or time
    You assume I'm fine
    But what would you do if I
    
    Break free and leave us in ruins
    Took this dagger in me and removed it
    Gain the weight of you then lose it
    Believe me, I could do it

    lyrics: `There I was again tonight
    Forcing laughter, faking smiles
    Same old tired, lonely place
    Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy
    Vanished when I saw your face
    All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you
    Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
    'Cross the room your silhouette
    Starts to make its way to me
    The playful conversation starts
    Counter all your quick remarks
    Like passing notes in secrecy
    And it was enchanting to meet you
    All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you
    This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
    I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
    I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
    I was enchanted to meet you
    The lingering question kept me up
    2 AM, who do you love?
    I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
    And now I'm pacing back and forth
    Wishing you were at my door
    I'd open up and you would say, "Hey"
    It was enchanting to meet you
    All I know is, I was enchanted to meet you
    This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
    I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
    I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
    That this night is flawless, don't you let it go
    I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
    I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
    I was enchanted to meet you
    This is me praying that
    This was the very first page
    Not where the story line ends
    My thoughts will echo your name, until I see you again
    These are the words I held back, as I was leaving too soon
    I was enchanted to meet you
    Please don't be in love with someone else
    Please don't have somebody waiting on you
    Please don't be in love with someone else
    Please don't have somebody waiting on you
    This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
    I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
    I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
    This night is flawless, don't you let it go
    I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
    I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
    I was enchanted to meet you
    Please don't be in love with someone else
    Please don't have somebody waiting on you`,

    They wishin' on me, yeah
    I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
    Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
    Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
    You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
    I don't wanna die for them to miss me
    Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me
    Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
    They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me
    God's plan, God's plan
    I hold back, sometimes I won't, yeah
    I feel good, sometimes I don't, ayy, don't
    I finessed down Weston Road, ayy, 'nessed

    And you know me
    Turn the O2 into the O3, dog
    Without 40, Oli', there'd be no me
    'Magine if I never met the broskis
    God's plan, God's plan
    I can't do this on my own, ayy, no, ayy
    Someone watchin' this shit close, yep, close
    I've been me since Scarlett Road, ayy, road, ayy

    Ooh, tell me
    I need to know, where do you wanna go?

    Make you lose control

    Nail done, hair done, everything did
    Nail done, hair done, everything did
    Oh, you fancy, huh?
    You getting ready so I know we gon be here awhile
    In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
    Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
    In the mall steady racking up the air miles
    Hit the gym, step on the scales, stare at the number
    You say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer
    And you don't do it for the man, men never notice
    You just do it for yourself you're the fucking coldest
    Intelligent too, ooh you're my sweetheart
    I've always liked my women book and street smart
    Long as they got a little class like half days
    And the confidence to overlook my past ways
    Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
    But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
    And look, I really think that nobody does it better
    I love the way you put it together
    Oh, you fancy, huh?
    Oh, you fancy, huh?
    Oh, you fancy, huh?
    Oh, you fancy, huh?

    Nail done, hair done, everything did
    Oh, you fancy, huh?
    Well, aren't you a breath of fresh air?
    From all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
    They get a baller think that they ain't got to pick a career
    Guess they plan on sucking dicks until some millions appear
    Like voila, you do it right he might just buy you a car
    Now she play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar
    Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
    I say I'm buying, you declining, now that's kinda bizarre
    Independent with the demeanor of an R&B singer
    Naked ring finger, M3 Beamer
    Champagne Range, Triple white Jag
    Closet full of brand new clothes and handbags
    Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel
    D&G, BCBG, Versace, Louie and BB
    You ain't needy, greedy or easy as these other breezy's
    Who fuck for bottles of Riesling and bowls of baked ziti
    Oh, you fancy, huh?
    Oh, you fancy, huh?
    Oh, you fancy, huh?
    Oh, you fancy, huh?
    Nail done, hair done, everything did
    Nail done, hair done, everything did

    Atlanta girls, let me see your hands
    Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
    Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
    Nails done hair done, everything big
    And my NY girls, let me see your hands
    Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
    Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big

    Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
    Girl you got it, let 'em know everything big
    Nails done hair done, nails done hair done
    Say go Cinderella, go Cinderella
    Orgasm blush, lipstick and concealer
    Devil in a tight dress, girl you a killer
    And ain't nobody realer, and ain't nobody realer,
    Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go...
    Showtime
    Go, go, go, go...
    As we proceed
    Uh, 5 and a half in boys, ass is off the hook
    Cinderella 'bout to lose the glass off her foot
    And when I find it is when I find you
    And we can do the things we never got the time to
    Better late than never but never late is better
    They tell me time is money, well we'll spend it together
    I'm down for whatever, you just lead the way
    We go to dinner you don't even look at me to pay
    Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
    And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
    How she got it I ain't never get to ask
    I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
    Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
    The girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us
    A little something extra, should we ever need it
    If it sounds like you, then let me hear you repeat it
    Oh, you fancy, huh?
    Oh, you fancy, huh?
    Oh, you fancy, huh?
    Oh, you fancy, huh?
    Nail done, hair done, everything did
    Nail done, hair done, everything did
    Oh, you fancy, huh?
    Oh, you fancy, huh?
    Oh, you fancy, huh?
    Oh, you fancy, huh?
    Nail done, hair done, everything did
    Nail done, hair done, everything did

    I'll be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
    Ha, and you don't even have to ask twice
    You could have my heart or we can share it like the last slice
    Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
    Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
    Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
    That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
    You don't even trip when friends say, "You ain't bringin' Drake along?"
    You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home

    Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that Tank shit
    Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
    When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
    And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for their sister
    Magazine, paper girl, but money ain't the issue
    They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
    She call me "The Referee" 'cause I be so official
    My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle
    Like the Andy Griffith theme song
    And who told you to put them jeans on?
    Double cup love, you the one I lean on
    Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
    Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
    Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
    Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
    All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot, I'm sayin'
    Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted

    We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
    I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know

    You hate the fact that you bought the dream
    And they sold you one
    And you love your friends, but somebody should've told you some'
